Compare their running times and show them. Which one performed better and why?

Linear Search running time: 5900
Interpolation running time: 577300

In this case the Linear Search performed better.  This is because there was not sorting done before the search.

Sorting the data can add a little bit more time to the running time. Another factor could be the input data.



Try to improve the running time of the linear search by at least 20% and explain your logic

I improved the Linear search by 30 percent and used the technique called Sentinel Linear Search.

The reason behind the sentinel linear search is to put the key we are searching for at the end of the array briefly. 

This operates as a sentinel value that lets us avoid the similarity check in each repetition of the loop. 

Instead, we only need to check the termination condition.
